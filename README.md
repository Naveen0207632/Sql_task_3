 SQL queries retrieve and filter data from a library database containing books and author tables.
 Basic SELECT statements are used to display all records, while subqueries filter books by authors' nationality (e.g., British). 
 Conditions like publication year, genre, and copies available help narrow down the selection. 
 Queries use pattern matching with LIKE to find names (e.g., '%George%') or titles starting with specific words (e.g., 'Harry%'). 
 Date ranges and null checks help identify authors born in certain eras or books missing author info. Sorting with ORDER BY is used to display results in a more readable form, such as by title or publication year.
